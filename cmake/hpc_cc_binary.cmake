include(CMakeParseArguments)

# Defines a C/C++ binary
#
# Given a binary 'foo' defined in root/a/b, this function will define a CMake
# target 'root_a_b_foo', which generates a binary of name 'foo'.
#
# Parameters:
#
# * NAME: the name of this binary
# * SRCS: the list of source files for this binary
# * DEPS: the list of libraries that this binary depends on
# * INCLUDES: the list of additional private include directories
# * COPTS: the list of private compile options
